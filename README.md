# Basch-Crawl
The successor to Lungon.

As the successor to Lungon Basch Crawl is written in BASH script. Development is being done under BASH 4.4.20 currently.
The original Lungon will be used to construct the main game interface once map generation works and I have something worth
controling.

Presently I am going through testing methods in the map_lib.sh to see what works and what doesn't.
